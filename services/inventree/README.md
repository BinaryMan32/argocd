# InvenTree

InvenTree doesn't officially support deploying on Kubernetes.
Created based on the [Docker Installation](https://docs.inventree.org/en/stable/start/docker_install/#required-files) instructions.

After the app has deployed and pods are ready, use Lens to start a terminal in either the worker or server pods.
Follow the [Create Administrator Account](https://docs.inventree.org/en/stable/start/docker_install/#create-administrator-account) instructions.
